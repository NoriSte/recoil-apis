# Re-implementing basic Recoil API

The goal of this repository is adding a new step to my learning path: re-implementing framework API. You can read more about this project on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NoriSte) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/noriste).

The implementd Recoil (v0.11) API are:

- `RecoilRoot`
- `atom` (sync version only)
- `selector` (sync version only)

You can play with the project on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/recoil-apis-gl2cb?file=/README.md), if you want to launch it locally:

- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`
